**Subject:** Help Needed Implementing the `BaseRenderer` Class in Python PDF Engine


Hi ,

I'm developing a PDF rendering engine in Python and need assistance with implementing the `BaseRenderer` class. This class is responsible for drawing text and graphics either to the screen or to an image file. I'm considering using a library to handle the drawing but haven't decided which one to use yet.

**Here's an overview of my current classes:**

```python
# deleted ...
```


# prompt 2

is it possible to use tkinter + python for gui applicatoin , but from iside of WSL2 Ubuntu ( on windows host )...

if yes , how ? and show me a simple setup and a simple gui app I can try ..
if no, show me other solution 


# prompt 3

now lets make a simple Gui tester app , for testing my pdf rendering engine ,write all the code for the gui in one script , the script should export these api (function) 
- a function "start(width,height)" which open the gui window 
- a function "show_page(some_args)" , which show a single pdf page , Iam using cairo for rendering page conten in an ImageSurface , so I can pass the ImageSurface Obj to it , and it shoud render the page and wait for user feedback 
- the user can give 2 feedback ("Yes", "NO") for the question about the page beeing rendered correctly , each feedback should have a corresponding button and a keymap "Ctrl+y" for yes , and "Ctrl+n" for no
- after user give feedback the function "show_page()" should return a boolean value representing user response.
- Bonus : the window should look nice and should be organized in a logical manner
- the function "start(..arg)",should revieve all the relavent argument for setting the correct window size ...
