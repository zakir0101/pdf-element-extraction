**Subject:** Help Needed Implementing the `BaseRenderer` Class in Python PDF Engine


Hi ,

I'm developing a PDF rendering engine in Python and need assistance with implementing the `BaseRenderer` class. This class is responsible for drawing text and graphics either to the screen or to an image file. I'm considering using a library to handle the drawing but haven't decided which one to use yet.

**Here's an overview of my current classes:**

```python
# engine/pdf_renderer.py

import re
from pdf_engine import PdfFont
from .pdf_operator import PdfOperator
from .engine_state import EngineState

class BaseRenderer:
    """
    [INSERT DOCSTRING HERE]
    """

    def __init__(self, state: EngineState) -> None:
        self.state = state
        self.default_char_width = 10
        self.functions_map = {
            "TJ": self.draw_string_array,
            "Tj": self.draw_string,
            "'": self.draw_string,
            '"': self.draw_string,
        }

    def initialize(self, width, height):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height
        # Initialization code here

    def draw_character(self, character: str, width: float, x: float, y: float):
        if len(character) > 1:
            raise ValueError("Character must be a single character")
        # Drawing logic here

    def draw_string(self, text: str):
        self.draw_string_array([text])

    def draw_string_array(self, text_array):
        x, y = self.state.get_text_position()
        font = self.state.font
        c_spacing = self.state.get_character_spacing()
        w_spacing = self.state.get_word_spacing()
        h_scaling = self.state.get_horizontal_scaling()
        for element in text_array:
            if isinstance(element, float):
                dx = self.state.convert_text_space_units_to_device_space_units(x, 0, True)[0]
                x += dx
                continue

            if not isinstance(element, str):
                continue
            for word in re.split(r'([ ]+)', element):
                if word.isspace():
                    x += w_spacing
                for char in word:
                    char_width = font.get_character_width(char) or self.default_char_width
                    self.draw_character(char, char_width, x, y)
                    x += char_width + c_spacing
                    x *= h_scaling

    def draw_line(self, x1, y1, x2, y2):
        # Line drawing logic here
        pass

    def execute_command(self, cmd: PdfOperator):
        func = self.functions_map.get(cmd.name)
        if func:
            func(*cmd.args)
```

**What I Need Help With:**

1. **Library Recommendations:** I'm looking for Python libraries that can facilitate drawing text and graphics to the screen or exporting to image files. I'm open to suggestions that fit well with the current class structure.

2. **Integration Tips:** Best practices for integrating a drawing library with the existing `BaseRenderer`, `EngineState`, and `PdfOperator` classes to ensure efficient rendering performance.

3. **Implementation Guidance:** Advice or example approaches on how to handle text positioning, scaling, and drawing basic graphics within the `BaseRenderer` class.

**Environment:**
- **IDE:** Neovim
- **Operating System:** Windows_NT

Any suggestions or guidance would be greatly appreciated!
